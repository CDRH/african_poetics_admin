# African Poets in the News

## Setup

Prepare database

- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`
- `rails db:seed`

## Questions

- person "bibliography" will need to be altered in the future to point at works, rather than freeform text field

- do university dates need to be freeform entry (1960s, ranges, etc)? or is YYYY acceptable?
