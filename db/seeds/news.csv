LAST ""MINSTREL"" OF NORTH AFRICA
FROM OUR ALGIERS CORRESPONDENT

Just after noon on January 12, almost at the beginning of Ramadan the famous Moslem poet Sheik Benguedda El Hadj Belarbi, died at Mazuna.  He was over 80, and had been il for a long time. For may years he lived at Ain-Morane, where he was the central figure in a group of native chiefs, the descendants of those who had fought in the border battles btween Bu-Maaza, the Sultan of the Dahra and the Warsenis, and Saint-Arnaud and Pelissier. He was the living history of those stirring times.
Later on he came to Mazuna and became the proprietor of a Moorish cafe, which was opened by M.Jules Cambon, then Governor-General of Algeria, and was for many years a place  of pilgrimage for poets from all over North Africa. His chief delight was in long improvisations, for which he relied on his remarkable retentive memory. In his library were to be found nearly all the works of the North African Moslem poets especialy those of Morocco and Western Algeria, and he would readily recite long narrative poems of over 1,200 lines, such as the famous Moslem poems of the seventeenth century. He died poor, having spent nearly all his money in paying scribes to record the traditional Moslem poetry. Wirh him has passed probably the last of those who have long borne the banner of Moslem ministrelsy in North Africa.",,"death, muslim, minstrel, ramadan, pilgrimage",

Nkosi cites Ranaivo, Rabearivelo, Rabemananjaro as cosmopolitan Malagasy poets; Walder suggests that these poets ""elicit from Nkosi close and sympathetic attention, and a convincing application of his overall argument - announced at the start as an obsessive idea that African writers are 'easily divisible' into two groups: those who see their society as unchanging, like a mask turned perpetually in the artist's hands, 'each time revealing nothing more than what it is, the work of some skillful carver who originally imparted to it its outstanding features'; and those writers who conceive 'of the act of writing as the carrying out of social tasks'."" Walder writes, ""As Nkosi applies this distinction, the remarkably rich and varied literary manifestations of the continent do begin to fall into a kind of order. And its application enables the critic to proceed to the level of insight which relates the different uses of, for example, traditional Malagasy folk poetry - the so-called hain-teny or proverb formula - by the poets concerned, to their respective personal and class positions: Rabearivelo, the 'deracinated' intellectual whose reworking of the hain-teny conceits read like translation; and Ranaivo, the rediscoverer of his own culture who integrates the hain-teny into his work, thus bringing together 'task' and 'mask'.""

Of the first, Godhorse, the first poetry collection by Kojo Laing, he writes ""The wit is characteristic, but every poem is different, perhaps the only common thread being the championing of sensory experience, especially in connection with religion. Laing handles surrealism well, and is capable of excellent passages."" Of The Fate of Vultures, Foden suggests that the anthology reflects the great depth of talent and vigour in modern African poetry. Foden quotes Seamus Heaney when he suggests that the poems in the collection 'have the potency of human testimony' and so are difficult to criticize.

All the familiar properties of the negritude a la Senegal are here; the nostalgia of the exile, the Ancients with their gnomic wisdom, the long horizons, the rejection of life and the here-and-now in favour of the dim and distant. But the poet fails to handle them with the distinction or originality which alone could make the rehash excusable.

Of Penguin's anthology, he writes, ""No work to date so completely misrepresents the full spectrum of poetry from this part of the world, and seems so perversely designed to mislead readers who do not already have extensive independent knowledge of local political and cultural history... Gray claims that all nations of southern African belong to a single 'literary system' whose importance overrides any division of the area into separate nation-states."" Of Watts, Watson has a more positive opinion, in that Watts instead makes the ""essential point"" that the work of black writers in South Africa is ""very different from that of African writers elsewhere.""

Delius suggests that Lenrie Peters' work is more of the first, while Mazisi Kunene's is the second. Delius quotes, ""An African critic has written that 'of all African poets of the English expression, he is the least concerned about his country and most concerned about the fate of the continent as a whole!'"" Meanwhile, ""Mazisi Kunene's 300-page dithyramb is dedicated to all the women of Africa, especially the renowned Zulu women, as well as to a couple of goddesses in the African pantheon... [Kunene] grew up listening to the insolent upholders of 'White Christian Civilization' who claimed that black people were unable to produce a civilization like their own or of any kind.

His poetry began to appear in 1905 and a selected edition with biographical introduction by Sir Robert Ensor was published by the Oxford University Press in 1947. Some of the poems in the book were obviously derivative, but others had force and originality from their blend of romantic, stoic, and satiric strains. He was deeply moved by the great themes of nature, character, and race in his native country. His Collected Poems was published last year.

Mason writes, ""From Senegal's indpendence, in 1960, until 1980 when he relinquished the Presidency of his nation, Leopold Sedar Senghor dominated the West African political and cultural scene as Maecenas, political philosopher and literary theorist and, not least, as a practising poet. Since his elevation in retirement to the Academie Francaise in 1983 and his move to Paris, the turmoil of his continent's political fortunes have so dimmed this renown that reappraisals of his writing now seem overdue. Melvin Dixon's English rendition of the definitive body of his poetry will, it is to be hoped, encourage this process."" Mason traces the history of the negritude movement and Senghor's involvement. She also criticizes some of the translation by Melvin Dixon, but ultimately praises the collection: ""Thus, while inadvertent infelicities occasionally muffle the poetry's African voice, nevertheless Melvin Dixon achieves that rarest of feats in the translation of poetry: he recreates Leopold Senghor in our own tongue, exhibiting with unflagging good faith his universality as a poet of love, of nature, of war and, rarest of modern accomplishments, of praise.",,"president, negritude, collection, review, language, identity",

Nigeria's is perhaps the only one stolen away by too much power and money and leisure and privilege... Hope has to come from the ordinary people. Today, the most outstanding leaders are emerging not from the ranks of the ruling class, but from among ordinary people who have despaired of the government and have decided to create their own path... And yet the irony is that democracy will ultimately work in favour of the ordinary Nigerian and against the politicians who pretend to be true democrats. The genius of democracy is that it is a self-perfecting system. The laws the politicians are now enacting as if in jest, under the assumption that they apply only to the common man and not to them, these same laws are what would work against them the day one good leader decides to enforce them.

Sir--You published a report in the Diary some time ago (May 16) that I had received a letter from Wole Soyinka. This letter contained one very disturbing paragraph which at the specific request of the Nigerians who had sent the letter on to me I could not immediately make public. Now I can. This paragraph reads: ""Physically not as good as may be expected. Serious eye complaint, no treatment. More than a year asking for treatment--ignored."" Last year in a letter dated August 23 Chief Awolowo wrote to me ""With reference to your letter dated July 11, 1968, I am reliably informed that Mr. Wole Soyika is alive and in good health."" It must be obvious that if Wole's letter to me was accurate then Chief Awolowo was seriously misinformed. In the gaols of the world many political prisoners languish, some in appalling conditions denied all contact with the outsside world, others tortured, humiliated, and forgotten. Protests from outside sometimes make these conditions harsher and it is often difficult to know when to speak and when to keep silent. To plead for compassion and understanding, to ask that the political prisoners in Nigeria should be treated with humanity, is not to take sides in the horrible conflict that is tearing the country apart. A country is judged ultimately by the humanity that it shows in such instances and in its adherence to civilized standards. I am not interested nor are others in getting special treatment for Wole Soyinka. We are interested in trying to ensure that he and others like him should be treated with compassion....",,"illness, arrest, solitary, imprisonment, jail",

Pringle undoubtedly after his return to Cape Town took a bitter view of all dealings of South Africans with the natives, and he may have been as wrong-headed as Professor Cory represents him; but at any rate his experiences as one of the earliest settlers on the Baviaans River and his enthusastic poems on the life he and his companions led should have awakened a sympathetic chord in so great a lover of the eastern province as Professor Cory...""

But we have dwelt on introductory matter sufficiently long already. It is not our purpose, in this paper, to discuss the genesis of poetry, or the capabilities of South Africa to evoke or sustain the poetic faculty. Our object is a much humbler and more pleasant one,--to introduce to our readers some of the writings of a South African poet, in which we think they will feel, as we have done ourselves, very considerably interested.

Yet a book like this, encyclopedic in form, is more likely to be consulted than read, and it might be felt that utility rather than readability ought to have been teh primary concern...As the survey approaches the present, its drawing o the literary map--at least of the British one--becomes very crude indeed.

In some cases, exile has nurtured creativity, giving writers the political space to reveal the disparity between official rhetoric and reality. But to many it has not been kind... Okot P'Bitek, the Ugandan poet, is not the only one who, lacking a connection to the society he longed to write about, drank himself to death... In some instances, though, the elaborate repressive apparatus of the state has stimulated creativity by compelling writers to develop subtle and imaginative ways of bypassing censorship. Jack Mapanje, Malwai's best-known poet, who was released in May last year after three-and-a-half years' detention without charge or trial, believes that the draconian measures taken by the Malawi Censorship Board may have inadvertently caused him to write better poems.

Mr. Okot's poem was originally composed in Lwo, the language of the Acoli people. Much of its imagery is rooted in their traditional songs of love, war, victory, and death. In rewriting his poem in English he has chosen a strong, simple idiom which preserves the sharpness and frankness of this imagery, a structure of short, free verses which flow swiftly and easily, and an uncondescending offer of all that is local and specific in the original... Inevitably lost is the pattern of rhyme, assonance and tonal variation offered by the vernacular. In the poet's own words, he has 'clipped a bit of the eagle's wings'.

The main accusation levelled here is that European critics have attempted to annex African literature for themselves. If a book is written in English or French then it is seen as a by-product or subdivision of the Great Tradition, of Modernism, or of some other beautified cultural monolith... They defend African orature against its alleged deficiencies in characterization and range of expression, and witheringly expose the pretensions of European critics who half get the point and so miss it by miles--in, for example, comparing the brevity of many African novels with oral tales... Toward the Decolonization of African Literature is not a pioneer study but it articulates a point of view which is increasingly heard among African critics and which has not previously been marshalled with so much damning quotation. It restores to literary criticism a brio, verging at times on insult, which is rare in Western criticism, where so often genteel irony or theoretical contortions are substituted for plain-spoken assertion of a fully held point of view. Also, the book is fundamentally right...""",,"decolonization, colonialism, westernization, criticism, review",

The issue is focused mainly on writing from eastern Africa, with contributions by Kenyans (Malusu Jose, Taban Lo Liyong, Stephen Ndichu, Barry Odour-Otieno, J. A. Opiche, Osotsi), Ugandans (Okot P'Bitek, Peter Nazareth), and a Somali (Abdi Sheik-Abdi). There are also items from other parts of the world, including poems by Andrew Salkey, and an instalment of Ezekiel Mphahlele's ""Notes from the Black American World"", entitled ""Images of Africa in Afro-American Literature"". Traditional oral narrative styles, as in Sheik-Abdi and P'Bitek, jostle the contemporary verse libre of Salkey and Ndichu. This combination is to be found also in the eleventh issue of Okike, which is devoted largely to writing by South Africans, including Don Mattera, Zulu Molefe, and Oswald Mtshali. Okike is handsomely designed and produced and the contents are impressive evidence of the range and vitality of African letters today.",,"collection, issue, orature, oral, narrative,",

The first successor to Lawino, Okot's Song of Ocol, was a disappointment, for it savoured too much of a conscientious attempt to give a voice to an essentially dull, pompous, and vindictive husband. But it was interesting to trace Okot's influence in the work of another Acoli writer, Okello Oculi, whose Orphan offered some passages of real bitterness and power...The impact of the second song is weakened by a slight sentimentalizing of the all-knowing, all-suffering harlot; yet here too Okot uses his new poetic language to induce the reader's sympathy to flow into strange places and to illuminate the corners of hidden lives. His songs are certainly one of the most original and important departures in the poetry of Africa today.""",,"review, imagery, language",

Even works which seem to honour African history with some straightforwardness, like Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart (1958), have hinted at interior weaknesses in the local personality which have been forewarnings of dissensions to come in the heyday of colonialism and of corruptions after independence... Ten years ago people argued whether Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter could be considered an African novel. Now they battle over the aesthetic criteria for evaluating literature which does not need to look to Europe for its legitimacy. Elizabethan England was ride with critical disputes and pamphleteering wars. The literature of Africa will not suffer if the same happens here."" ",,"review, criticism, Elizabethan, literature",

This was a seminar organised by the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid and held in Havana, attended by 200 delegates including the crucial nucleus of leading African sports officials and SAN-ROC. It was at this stage that Dennis Brutus, the president of SAN-ROC, a professor of English in the African Studies Department at the Northwest University of Illinois, threw his own acknowledged ability and experience and that of SAN-ROC unequivocally behind the African protest. Brutus, an exiled coloured South African, who was imprisoned in South Africa as a result of his views on apartheid, was portrayed in oarts of the British and foreign Press last week as a somewhat sinister figure. Yet, it is he who turned to de Broglio in Havana to say: 'If they (the African countries) are prepared to go through all this--which is much more than we would ever ask--who are we to quarrel?

Denis Brutus, president of the South African Non-racial Open Comittee for Olympic Sports (SANROC) characterised the move as a blow to black South Africans who want multi-racial sport. There are two black sports groups in South Africa--those who agree with SAONGA president Frank Braun's proposals for organised separate black and white sports activities; and those who will not negotiate on any basis other than multi-racial sport. 'I am afraid,' says Brutus, 'that this means that the first group have agreed to co-operate with Mr Braun on what amounts to an apartheid platform.'

Brutus was the centre of a diplomatic incident last September after he was shot down in a busy Johannesburg street by a police warrant officer as he made a dash for freedom. Brutus was banned and confined to the magisterial area of Johannesburg last year after his return from Europe where he had made representations about discrimination in Olympic teams. He broke his ban and went to Swaziland from where he intended to return to Europe to approach Olympic headquarters in Switzerland, but after crossing the border into Mozambique he was arrested by Portuguese secret police and returned to South Africa. Brutus said at the time and repeated in court today, while pleading in mitigation of sentence, that he had had a valid Rhodesian Federation passport. During the diplomatic row at that time Pretoria submitted that Brutus was a South African citizen. The magistrate ruled that Brutus's contention that his escape bid was made to draw attention to his situation was not altogether valid, but the court would take into account that he had been wounded, which was a partial penalty for his offence.

Edinburgh.,Event|Political,,"[Full Text]: ""A mass boycott of the British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh next July has been threatened by the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa and the South African Non-Racial Committee for Olympic Sport if the South African cricket tour of England is not called off. The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which includes 36 countries in its membership has cabled the British Government stating that African countries will withdraw from the Edinburgh games in protest at what they regard as racism in cricket. Mr. Denis Brutus, the chairman of Sanroc, said in London last night: ""At a recent meeting of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa which was held in Cairo our representatives had never seen such militancy expressed on the question of the visit of the South African cricketers. We in Sanroc are now proposing to cable all member countries of the Commonwealth Games Federation asking them to boycott the games. The latest development in the controversy over the cricket tour indicates to us that many very prominent people in Britain are giving their support to the M.C.C. We feel so strongly about this blatant racism that we regretfully have to fight back,"" he said. The chairman of the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa is Mr. Abraham Ordia, a member of the Nigerian National Olympic Committee and the secretary is Mr. Jean-Claude Ganga from Brazzaville. It was, at first, the Kenyan Minister for Sport who suggested that no sportsman from his country would run in Edinburgh against anyone who had competed in the all-white South African games last year. He has been given the full support of black Africa and it is felt that Asian and West Indian members of the Commonwealth will soon follow suit. Mr. Brutus said: ""I hope that even at this late date it is not too late for a change of mind in Britain. But the most recent developments suggest the South Africans will still play here with far-reaching effects upon international sport.""

Significantly, not one griot or towncrier from the oral tradition had been invited; not one representative of African literatures in African langauges participated. Many participants criticized the Eurocentrism of the Nobel theme. While Gabriel Okara (a Nigerian novelist and poet of the generation which began to publish at the time of independence in the early 1960s) saw the Nobel award as a 'recognition of African literature in the global context'. Zulu Sofola, a Nigerian playwright of the next generation, viewed it with reservations: 'If the award was given to Soyinka as a ticket to enable us to enter into the club of Western writers, then it is not useful to us.' A third interpretation was offered by William Conton, a novelist from Sierra Leone, who thought of it as 'a recognition of an African writer, who writes according to the concept of literary excellence of a group of Europeans.' In his address to the Conference, the Nigerian president, Ibrahim Babangida, stressed the need to preserve African literature in native language as the use of foreign languages tends, he said, to obscure the character of these works. G. G. Darah of Nigeria, citing the example of his researches into the oral literature of the Urhobo, declared that the corpus of the African spoken tradition is vaster than that of Europhone literature, and that its preoccupations are more relevant to the majority of Africans today; the Nigerian poet and polemicist, Chinweizu, argued that the Nobel was irrelevant to African culture: Europhone African literature--barely a century old--should take second place to Afrophone African literature, which is at least 5,000 years old. Eurocentrics attempted to curb the tide of Afrocentrism with vague pleas for cultural 'universalism'; or with claims that a return of the sources of African civilization would be 'naive romanticism' but at the end of the five-day conerence it was clear that the indigenous agenda had won. A resolution honouring Cheikh Anta Diop, whose studies in Egyptology recovered for African heritage the achievements of the Egypt of the pharoahs, was moved from the floor and added to the official communique.""",,"literature, afrophone, criticism, language, native, indigenous, foreign, oral, orature, griot, towncrier, tradition",

There are two spurs which are likely to gaod the non-European writer more and more in the direction of experiment in the coming years. First, the sense of alienation which is apt to pursue him everywhere once he becomes fully aware, in the search for an identity, of what he is not... Secondly, those who are attempting to record in English or in French the lives of people who do not spak them are immediately confronted with the absolute necessity to experiment with langauge. They may attempt to transfer the imagery, the speech-rhythms, or even, as Gabriel Okara of Nigeria has done in one interesting chapter, the actual syntax of vernacular speech. Whatever they do, they cannot evade the problem, for language taken straight from the European novel or stage will ring falser than any experiment...""",,"language, speech, western, avant-garde, review, criticism, imagery",

Both editors deny, in remarkably similar language, that they started out with the intention of making an anthology. Ulli Beier has drawn his material from the best stories which have appeared over the past five years in the magazine Black Orpheus, of which he has been one of the editors from its inception in 1957.... Cook's collection has an even closer university connexion, being derived from Penpoint, which was founded in 1958-59, the magazine of the English Department of Makerere University College in Kampala, the capital of Uganda...The Black Orpheus collection represents the second generation. In West Africa the use of English is long domesticated and now comes the urge to play with it. There is nothing here by Amos Tutuola, the first of the Nigerians to erupt into the consciousness of the European reading public with his startling word-play and fantastic subjects, but Gabriel Okara from Eastern Nigeria carries the game even further but also the syntax of his native Ijaw...""

They were concerned mostly with one or other of the many external examinations of London University or the City and Guilds... When I was a boy things were rather different. Books were rare indeed. I remember the very strong impression made on me by the rows and rows of books in my school library when I first got there in 1944. I was, of course, most fortunate in gaining admission to a government college, one of those rare schools which the colonial administration built and endowed lavishly, for obscure reasons of its own. Cricket was played zealously and, in one of them at least, Eton Fives. But their most valuable asset was books. It is no doubt significant that, besides myself, almost all of the first generation of Nigerian writers had gone to one of the four or five government colleges; T. M.

",,,,,,,,,"[Excerpt]: ""Visitors to West Africa have often remarked that whereas in French territories Africans speak either immaculate French or none at all, in British West Africa many speak some form of broken or pidgin English. Mostly this is attributed to the fact that the French built far fewer schools than the British, but provided a thorough secondary education. At the same time it was their avowed policy to assimilate Africans to French culture. Since they claimed that West Africa was not really a colony but ""France Outre-Mer"", Africans were considered as underprivileged only as long as they did not have a French education... On the other hand Nigeria made a very late start. There was nothing at all before Mr. Tutuola's The Palm-Wine Drinkard, which was published in 1952. Even then it took years before literature in Nigeria got off the ground. But the past few years have seen a literary activity here that equals anything in French West Africa. There are at least four novelists of interest: Achebe, Ekwensi, Nzekwu and Babatunde Jones (the last unpublished); there are lively poets: Okara, Soyinka, Clark and Okigbo--the first two represented on the previous page. There are the playwrights: Soyinka, Clark, Yetunde Esan. The place is full of literary criticism and controversy; there are literary journals, clubs and associations."" ...",,"literature, territory, racism, pidgin, language, assimilation, criticism, review",

Any reader turning first to Eustace Palmer, as being the African in this brace of critics, is likely to be disappointed in his search for special illumination.... The collection of recorded interviews with various authors assembled in African Writers Talking derives its value from the fact that most of the writers have been interviewed several times, over a period of some years, and by different interlocutors. The result is a considerable illumination of the developing consciouness in men like Achebe, Okigbo, Awoonor, Ngugi, and Soyinka; consciousness about their own work, the nature of the art in which they work, and the degree of their obligation to be quite consciously teachers, stimulators and even admonishers of their societies....""

The first feeling this anthology produces, then, is something like awe at the degree of world-wide understanding that it registers. The poets come from twenty-two countries, but nearly all have some dash of that special intuition with language--in this case, with English--that makes a man a poet.

What differences can be discerned between teh handling of the language by native English speakers like Jack Cope and by writers approaching it from another culture, with another music in their ears, like Achebe and Kariara?

To a certain extent this happens anywhere--the Russians themselves, for instance, often do the same thing for that of capitalist countries, sometimes with very misleading results--and it is a useful enough pastieme so long as it is not allowed to determine aesthetic judgments...Even then, if white writers are excluded from consideration, as they tacitly were throughout the conference, the basis for any kind of critical generalization is still slight. Perhaps that is why both Mr. Donatus Nwoga's paper on the short story and Mr. Mphahlele's own on the novel consisted largely of lengthy quotations from a handful of writers. Even Mr. Ulli Beier, of Ibadan, who is the outstanding critic in this field, confined himself virutally to the writings of the Nigerians Christopher Okigbo and J. P.

This is partly a result of sheer volume, in that Nigeria with its huge population has more internationally known writers than any other country in independent Africa. It is partly a result of being early in the field, and in many parts of the world African writing was first discovered in the books of Chinua Achebe and Cyprian Ekwensi... Wole Soyinka, novelist and playwright, has published work in Yoruba and in English. Achebe has never felt able to write creatively in Ibo and has written in English. A further point to note about the Ibo group of writers is that although their ethnic origins are Ibo, their experience was often national and before the political crisis so was much of their writing...""",,"literature, writing, language, translation, international, global, painting, war",

General editor of this series which, including forthcoming books, extends to some 73 titles, is the Ibo, Chinua Achebe, whose first novel, Things Fall Apart, published in 1958, is a classic of modern African writing which has become well known through translations into many languages...[Achebe] identifies himself wholeheartedly with the Biafran cause and he and two other gifted young writers, Cyprian Ekwensi and Gabriel Okara, have undertaken highly paid lecture tours in the United States to raise funds for their country.

Biafra.,Event|Political,,"[Excerpt]: ""On September 18, 1967, two months after appointing himself major in the Biafran army, Christopher Okigbo--a thirty-seven-year-old patriot, classicist, and poet--was riddled by bullets during a battle to contain the federal Nigerian army in the university town of Nsukka, where he had once worked as the college librarian. Fifty-three Brigade, to which he had attached himself in a dramatic act of solidarity, was in full retreat, with the exception of Okigbo himself, who had decided to hold his ground in an ill-protected bunker. When the enemy arrived, he tried to lob a grenade at a tank. His body was never found. His memory, though, haunts African writing... As Obi Nwakanma's well-researchd biography proves, however, impetuous action was a recurring aspect of his personality. With the exception of his poetry, Okigbo could never settle to anything for very long...""",,"death, war, secession, biography",

The enterprise is undoubtedly worth while: our world is certainly not politically a single world, but culturally it is becoming at least potentially so. In literature, as in music and the visual arts, we feel a need to have some knowledge by report of what we may never know by acquaintance... In the African section of the fourth volume, the late Christopher Okigbo is credited with being 'one of the most exciting poets now writing in Africa,' and some critics might feel that the formative Western influence was Pound rather than Eliot. The poet from Gambia described as 'Leurie Peters' should surely be Lenrie Peters. It is pleasant to find that very fine bilingual writer in Afrikaans and English, Uys Krige, dealt with briefly,  but with proper respect, as is the highly civilized and persecuted South African poet, Dennis Brutus. The note on the Nigerian dramatist Wole Soyinka mentions that his most famous play, The Lion and the Jewel, 'presents the impositions of modern civilization as a threat to the African villagers' individuality.' ...""

It is now over two years since the war ended, yet the published material by Nigerians themselves is still very sparse. This is understandable on severa grounds: first, although many were prepared during the war to join the propaganda effort on both sides, in the post-war mood of reconciliation there has been a natural desire to bury the past... But I cannot conclude without nothing the impact of the war on creative writing. Nigeria's writers, not initially very obviously politically committed, became caught up in the turbulence of events. For example, the poet Christopher Okigbo joined the Biafran army and was killed: the dramatist Wole Soyinka, who had earlier been deeply affected by the political crisis, was detained in a federal jail for much of the war...""",,"war, death, Biafra, propaganda, postwar, literature",

""Geoffrey Hill's essays and Oxford lectures frequently return to the two brief appearances Sidney Godolphin makes in Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan... Odi Barbare, Hill's subsequent book, initially appears even more forbiddingly mediated. Its title comes from a book by the nineteenth-century Italian poet Giosue Carducci, whose use of Classical metres may have led Hill to cast this sequence of fifty-two poems in sapphics. Each of Hill's poems originates in associations stemming from his title, so the book teems with references to Italian poets (Dante, Petrarch), political thinkers (Gramsci, Croce), theologians (Joachim of Fiore, Hugh of St Victor) and famous visitors (Henry James, Ezra Pound). Hill finds room for Sir Philip Sidney, who also used sapphics, and there are ""praise-songs"" for many other figures whose connection to the title is less clear, such as Christopher Okigbo, Thomas Masaryk and the Cambridge mathematician Frank Ramsey...""",,"lecture, essay, collection, reference, song, praise, faith, theology",

In Chinua Achebe's profound novels comes the most skilful handling of the theme: the bridging of time between village and city, all illuminated with a variety of tone, a subtlety of speech, which is only now being recognized, and which needed the critical understanding of John Pepper Clark, the Nigerian dramatist, to make the social nuances of its characters clear to the non-African reader...""",,"city, village, tone, death, drum, mask, murder, war, despair",

It was the first in the African Writers Series, the Heinemann Educational Books project that revolutionized the field of of anglophone African writing by providing literature for African readers by African writers....

Its American editor-in-chief, Mrs. Rosalie Murphy, says she ran into many problems. In Nigeria, the questionnaire sent to Wole Soyinka was not passed on to him in prison, where he has been for two years; while the entry on Christopher Okigbo had to be dropped after Mrs. Murphy had confirmed a report that he had been killed in the civil war. Then there were many black South African poets who have escaped from or otherwise left the country and still move from place to place: Bloke Modisane, believed to have left South Africa on foot in 1950, was traced to London. Minor racial complications occurred in this country, too. Most poets from Wales put down ""Welsh"" as their nationality, although some admitted to ""Anglo-Welsh.""

Yeats and Ezra Pound was confined to the literary fringe of revoution, and only the poets of the Irish and Spanish Republics, Patrick Pearse, and Garcia Lorca, seem fit to be considered in the same breath as Goethe and Byron. Last week's Insight story on running illicit arms to Nigeria (""Gun-running via Birminham"") has, however, produced a contemporary contender for the role, a distinguished Nigerian poet, Christopher Okigbo. Okigbo, a member of the beleagured Ibo tribe from Eastern Nigeria, planned the deal with a French ex-policeman, Paul Favier to transport 1,007 sub-machine guns to defend the Ibo against the ravages of the Hausa tribesmen from Northern Nigeria. After a short stay in Geneva, where the negotiations with Favier took place, Okigbo flew to Rotterdam shortly before an ancient DC 4 took off on its ill-fated flight. Indeed, he was due to travel with the aircraft, but fortuitously changed his mind at the last moment. When the aircraft crashed in Cameroun just north of the Nigerian border two days later, a suitcase and some books belonging to Okigbo were found among the wreckage. CLASSICAL SCHOLAR. Born in 1932, Okigbo was educated at the Ibadan University where he was a classical scholar. After graduation, he became private secretary to the Nigerian Minister of Research and Information, but two years later he left to teach, and eventually represented the Cambridge University Press in West Africa. His poetry, as yet, shows no signs of political commitment. Although in one of his T. S. Eliot-inspired works the refrain reads: ""& the mortor is not yet dry...""; it refers, prosaically, to construction material not weapons of war. But Okigbo has during the last month gathered the raw material for what could, if he writes it, be the first epic poem about an illicit arms deal.""

Many of their authors will not have faced the question which their unique position asks them; of those that have, a surprising number will turn out to belong to that amazing generation of Nigerians--it includes Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, J. P. Clark, Christopher Okigbo--who made their debuts in the late Fifties and early Sixties. For these writers, examined in detail in Bruce King's Introduction to Nigerian Literature, a consciousness of their own cultural dilemma proved not an inhibition but a spur. Unlike Tutuola, whose imaginatively translated Yoruba foklore owes its richness as much to mistranslation of Yoruba as to a feeling for the adopted language itself, they are constantly aware of their responsibilites... Those who have picked the clearest path are without doubt the Ibo novelist Chinua Achebe and the Yoruba playwright Wole Soyinka. Soyinka is a poet, in love with words, images and myths, whose plays blend in a unique mixture all the rich formal elements of European drama with the haunting complexities of African ritual. The accomodation here between teh two cultures is complete. Gerald Moore's Wole Soyinka is a useful introduction for the student, but of course there is no substitute for reading or, if possible, seeing Soyinka's marvellous plays...""",,"audience, art, sculpture, language, culture, Yoruba, folklore, muth, drama",

In both cases the critique of a 'white' culture (whether European, American, or South African)--its assu,ptions, blind spots, abuses of language, logic or humanity--is based on a scrupulous examination of evidence, as it emerges within early travel writing, anecdotes, or the work of individual authors who appear to be transmittig the 'truth' of a continent and its indigenous peoples, but are often perpetuating Western conceptual grids...

Some of the Yeats miscellanies reviewed last year in these columns bore the mark of being compiled for an occasion. A first-rate critical or scholarly article, on any great writer, tends to ripen in the critic's or scholar's mind over the years...The Ibadan volume contains a very fine commemorative poem by one of the most brilliant of West African poets now writing in English, Mr. Christopher Okigbo...""",,"volume, commemorative, poem, centenary, biography",

It was clear throughout that the 'less developed' countries regarded the provision of books in the English language as of the utmost importance... More and more Africans are being appointed as local managers of these [publishing] houses, as for instance Chief Solaru (O.U.P.), Christopher Okigbo (Cambridge) or Chief Fagunwa (Heinemann), all established in Ibadan; also a new publishing house has recently been set up in Lagos... But there is also an increasing amount of high-quality creative writing in English--especially in West Africa, where British publishers have acquired some welcome new authors.
