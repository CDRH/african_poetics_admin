Escarpments (Poems 1973 - 2007) (2008)",,,"Patrick Cullinan, born in 1932, spent the majority of his adult life in South Africa, though he struggled with his identity as a South African due to his childhood spent in England. Cullinan, alongside Lionel Abrahams, founded ""The Bateleur Press"" in 1974 and later the literary journal ""The Bloody Hourse"" in 1980. Cullinan was a renown poet, winning awards such as the Slug Award, the Olive Schreiner Prize, three Pringle Awards, the Sanlam Literary Award and the Merit Award.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cullinan","With Lionel Abrahams, he founded the Bateleur Press in 1974, and the literary journal The Bloody Horse: Writings and the Arts in 1980. Through the journal (the title taken from a poem by Roy Campbell) Cullinan sought to re-establish the standing of poetry in South Africa. Influences included John Betjeman, W. B. Yeats, Eugenio Montale, Rimbaud, and Dante.

Cullinan maintained close contact with other poets writing in South Africa, notably Gus Ferguson. Before their deaths, he was a friend and fellow writer to Lionel Abrahams, Guy Butler, Douglas Livingstone and Stephen Watson.

He is amongst the greatest of the Afrikaner poets and remains one of the most popular, although his output was not large. Opperman described him as the first professional Afrikaner poet; Marais believed that craft was as important as inspiration for poetry. Along with J.H.H. de Waal and G.S.

Moloise was accused of murdering a black police officer. The African National Congress claimed responsibility for the murder and repudiated the claim that Moloise was involved. The US and the Soviet Union warned the apartheid government against the execution, but the government still decided to go ahead with it. The execution aroused so much anger in the townships that violence escalated. It spiraled out of control and subsequently reached areas like the Johannesburg CBD which had previously remained sheltered from it. ","Accessed 11/4/2019

The literature of Serote’s fellow writers Sipho Sepamla, Oswald Mtshali, Chris van Wyk, Mafika Gwala and Don Mattera spurred on the political ideals of anti-apartheid popular movements. Many of these works aimed at mobilising audiences; the immediate impact of drama and poetry drove the momentum for change.","Accessed 11/11/2019
